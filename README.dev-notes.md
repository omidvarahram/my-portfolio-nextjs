Developer notes:
- Use Yarn as requested. `yarn install` will install the latest packages (package.json points to "latest").
- If you prefer pinned versions, replace "latest" with exact semver ranges before running `yarn install`.
- Jest is configured using Next's `next/jest` helper in `jest.config.js`.
- Type declarations are loaded via `next-env.d.ts` and `tsconfig.json`.
